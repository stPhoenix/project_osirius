          Sign up form is pretty simple. Aside from username, password and email fields, you should select your home language(the language you speak and understand) - foreign words translation will be on  this language, and choose learn language - language you want to learn.

          You can use two ways to add foreign words for learn - by typing(system will try find word in database or internet) or by choosing from presets. If you choose presets - page will show words by category. If no words for your language pair(home language - learn language) you won't see anything. As service was made by me, current presets have words for pair english - japanese. I highly advise contributing in github for filling presets by words on different languages. Othewise - add words by typing based on your own needs.
