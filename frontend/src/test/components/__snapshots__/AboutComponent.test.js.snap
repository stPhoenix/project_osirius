    Hello everyone!
  </h2>
  <p
    className="align-self-start"

    I've been trying to 
    <b>
      learn
    </b>
     Japanese by myself from textbooks and manuals.
  </p>
  <p

     When I started I had faced one big problem: how to 
    <b>
      learn words
    </b>
    ? The popular solution is to make cards and learn by them. But honestly, for me it was too inconvenient - I'm too lazy to do such things.
  </p>
  <p
    className="align-self-start"

    So I'd found another solution - to write a program that helps in studing Japanese words. And not only Japanese, 
    <b>
      other languages
    </b>
    , too. Don't know why I wasn't lazy to code it)) I keep telling myself that laziness is the engine of progress.

    First I wrote a telegram bot. It was 
    <b>
      convenient
    </b>
     in learning words but inconvenient in managing word lists (i.e. deleting learnt words and adding new ones). So my next step was to 
    <b>
      upgrade
    </b>
     that telegram bot to a web version. Have you already guessed that you're using it right now?

    What this app can do for 
    <b>
      you
    </b>
    :
    <li>
      - help to 
      <b>
        learn
      </b>
       words in different languages (main idea);
    </li>
    <li>
      - switch between different learnt languages;
    </li>
    <li>
      - add words for 
      <b>
        learning
      </b>
       from presets;
    </li>
    <li>
      - add words for 
      <b>
        learning
      </b>
       by typing (in this case app will search translation over internet);
    </li>
    <li>
      - 
      <b>
        study words
      </b>
      :
      <ul>
        <li>
          + by matching word with its translation (and reverse);
        </li>
        <li>
          + by looking at word and typing translation(and reverse);
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
